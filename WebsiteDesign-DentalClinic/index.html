                      <p>First, you need to find out if the brushing method is correct. No matter how hard you wipe, if the method is not correct, the effect will be reduced. Also, if you like sweets or have a habit of eating frequently, caries can occur well, and caries can occur even if the secretion of saliva is low. In this case, it is recommended to visit the hospital and take appropriate measures after consulting a dentist. Learn to brush your teeth correctly at Shinsegae Dental. ^^</p>

						It is recommended that the scaling cycle is usually performed once every 6 months, 3 months for those who are unmanageable or those who have plaque well, and once a year for those who are well managed. In the case of scaling, since the calculus between the teeth has been removed, the teeth may be temporarily unstable and feel shaking.If there is a lot of calculus between the teeth, a space will be created after the calculus is removed. Plaque was filling the space. Once the space between the teeth and the lowered gum cannot be recovered, the only way to maintain it is to maintain its current condition. Since scaling is a treatment that removes only plaque and calculus attached to the teeth, it does not damage the teeth at all, and teeth aching after scaling is a temporary phenomenon, so it is recommended to avoid excessively irritating food for about a week.</p>

                      <p>The timing of extraction of wisdom teeth is not fixed. In general, pain and tooth decay occur when it comes to the top of the gum, so it is important to understand the timing of when it comes to the top of the gum to extract teeth, so it is recommended to consult a dentist about when to extract wisdom teeth through periodic dental checkups. In some cases, wisdom tooth extraction may be required before orthodontic treatment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pop4">
                      <span>✖</span>
                      <p>The tooth decay begins from the outer part of the tooth and gradually grows in size and proceeds toward the inner nerve. A painful tooth decay is when the tooth decay has progressed considerably. If possible, treating cavities when it hasn't progressed as much is a way to preserve as many teeth as possible.</p>

                      <p>Implants usually wait 3 months after surgery before prosthetics are inserted, and the healing period may be longer by 4-6 months depending on the bone condition at the time of the patient's surgery.</p>

						If the mouth is protruding, remove the molars and put the front teeth back into the house to see a visual effect that makes the jaw line look slim as the mouth enters.</p>

						Of course, it is a good idea to keep as many healthy magnetic teeth as possible. Therefore, if possible, it is recommended to treat teeth without removing them, but the reason for tooth extraction in orthodontic treatment is to provide a space to properly arrange the remaining teeth. If space can be secured without extraction, it is better to avoid extraction. If not, removing the most unnecessary teeth to secure space will help the remaining teeth to remain functional and aesthetically long. Therefore, it is better to think of extraction as one of the necessary steps to get the best results rather than saying which method is good.</p>

						In orthodontic treatment, tooth movement is a treatment that uses the reaction between cells in the alveolar bone surrounding the tooth. Considering the cell response, you visit the hospital every 3 to 6 weeks. On average, you can think of it as 1 to 2 times a month. If excessive force is applied for rapid treatment, side effects such as slow tooth movement or shortening of tooth root may occur. As the tooth moves smoothly only when the proper force is delivered at the right time, you can visit the hospital on the appointed date. . If you do not keep your appointments well, you may be concerned about extending the treatment period and increasing the difficulty of treatment.</p>

                      <p>The implant root is semi-permanent. The lifespan of the implant is determined by the patient's condition at the time of surgery and how you follow up after surgery. It is recommended to replace the implant head like a general prosthesis after 8-10 years of use. After a successful implant procedure, it can be maintained for a long time if the patient's oral cleanliness and the examination through periodic revisits are well performed. If this is not the case, there may be cases in which the post itself embedded in the jawbone may fall out due to periodontitis around the implant or fail to perform its proper function.</p>

                      <p>Neurotherapy is a treatment that removes infected nerves in the teeth. Neurotherapy is the same as if the skin is injured and there are uncomfortable and painful symptoms until the wound heals. Usually, there may be uncomfortable symptoms in the duration of 1 to 2 neurological treatments, but it is not very uncomfortable. However, the degree of pain varies depending on the patient. If you are very sick, it is recommended to take pain relievers.</p>
